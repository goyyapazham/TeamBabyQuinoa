ACTIVITY 1
1. How many bits does it take to represent the values from 0 to 255? 8 bits
2. How many bytes does it take to represent a color in the RGB color model? 1 byte
3. How many pixels are in a picture that is 640 pixels wide and 480 pixels high? 307200 pixels


ACTIVITY 2
1. How can you make pink? R=255;G=57;B=249
2. How can you make yellow? R=255;G=241;B=42
3. How can you make purple? R=136;G=11;B=235
4. How can you make white? R=255;G=255;B=255


ACTIVITY 3
1. What is the row index for the top left corner of the picture? 0
2. What is the column index for the top left corner of the picture? 0
3. The width of this picture is 640. What is the rightmost column index? 639
4. The height of this picture is 480. What is the bottom most row index? 479
5. Does the row index increase from left to right or top to bottom? Top to bottom
6. Does the column index increase from left to right or top to bottom? Left to right
7. Set the zoom to 500%. Can you see squares of color? This is called pixelation. Pixelation means displaying a picture so magnified that the individual pixels look like small squares. 


ACTIVITY 4
n/a

ACTIVITY 5
1. Open Picture.java and look for the method getPixels2D. Is it there? No
2. Open SimplePicture.java and look for the method getPixels2D. Is it there? Yes
3. Does the following code compile? DigitalPicture p = new DigitalPicture(); No, you can’t instantiate an interface
4. Assuming that a no-argument constructor exists for SimplePicture, would the following code compile? DigitalPicture p = new SimplePicture(); Yes. The object type would be a SimplePicture.
5. Assuming that a no-argument constructor exists for Picture, does the following code compile? DigitalPicture p = new Picture(); Yes. Picture is below DigitalPicture in hierarchy
6. Assuming that a no-argument constructor exists for Picture, does the following code compile? SimplePicture p = new Picture(); Yes. Picture is parent of child.
7. Assuming that a no-argument constructor exists for SimplePicture, does the following code compile? Picture p = new SimplePicture(); No. Picture extends SimplePicture, not the other way around.
